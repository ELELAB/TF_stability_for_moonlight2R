# TF_mutation_stability
Investigation of stability effects of mutations on transcription factors.

The primary objective of this project is to investigate the impact of TFs missense mutations on their structural stability and to establish a direct link between these mutations and alterations in gene expression profiles observed in lumA cancer patients. This analysis leverages a systems biology approach rooted in multi-omics data integration, combining structural insights with gene regulatory dynamics, mutational data and gene expression to uncover mechanistic pathways driving oncogenesis.

To achieve this,  MAVISp, a modular framework for the structural interpretation of mutations, and Moonlight2R, a predictive framework for identifying cancer driver genes are used. By integrating these tools, the study aims to identify target genes influenced by mutated TFs and elucidate their roles in cancer progression.
